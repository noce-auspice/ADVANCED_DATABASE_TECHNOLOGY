-- Agricultural Distributed Database Management System 

-- Project Overview

-- This project implements a distributed agricultural database management system using PostgreSQL 
-- with horizontal fragmentation, distributed queries, and business rule enforcement. The system manages 
-- farm data across multiple database nodes with comprehensive data integrity and performance 
-- optimization.


-- Case Study: Agricultural Harvest Management
-- Business Context
-- Farm Operations: Tracks agricultural fields, crop types, and harvest
-- yields across distributed database nodes

-- Distributed Architecture: Data horizontally fragmented across Node_A 
-- and Node_B for performance and scalability

-- Data Integrity: Ensures ACID properties across distributed fragments using two-phase commit

--  SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & IMPLEMENTATION
 
-- A1: Horizontal Fragmentation & Recombination
-- Objective: Split the main Harvest table into horizontal fragments based on 
-- harvest_id range and create a unified view that transparently combines both fragments.

-- Technical Approach:

-- Range-based partitioning on harvest_id (1-5 on Node_A, 6-10 on Node_B)

-- Uses PostgreSQL dblink extension for cross-node queries

-- Creates a unified view that appears as a single table to applications

-- Implements data validation through checksums and row counts

-- This script creates the necessary tables on both Node_A and Node_B.
-- Run it on each node after connecting to the respective database.

-- Table: Field (Stores information about agricultural fields)
CREATE TABLE Field (
    field_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    field_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(150),
    size_acres NUMERIC
);

-- Table: Crop (Stores types of crops)
CREATE TABLE Crop (
    crop_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    crop_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    season VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Table: Harvest (Main fact table for harvest records)
-- We will fragment this table later in A1.
CREATE TABLE Harvest (
    harvest_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    field_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    crop_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    harvest_date DATE NOT NULL,
    yield_kg NUMERIC NOT NULL CHECK (yield_kg > 0),
    CONSTRAINT fk_harvest_field FOREIGN KEY (field_id) REFERENCES Field(field_id),
    CONSTRAINT fk_harvest_crop FOREIGN KEY (crop_id) REFERENCES Crop(crop_id)
);


-- 1. Create horizontal fragments based on a RANGE rule on harvest_id.
CREATE TABLE Harvest_A AS
SELECT * FROM Harvest WHERE harvest_id <= 5; -- IDs 1-5 go to Node_A

-- 2. Insert 5 rows into Harvest_A (on Node_A)
